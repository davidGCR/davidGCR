### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer with a strong background in Computer Science. I have three years of experience as a full-stack developer including front-end, back-end, cloud development with AWS. I have three years of experience as a Data Engineer and one year as a Machine Learning Engineer. I have a strong background in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Parallel Programming, Video Processing, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Actually, I am looking for opportunities to do research or to participate in projects about Machine Learning in fields such as Computer Vision, NLP, and Data Science.
